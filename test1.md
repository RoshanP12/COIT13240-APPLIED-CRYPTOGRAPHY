Question 1 working out:
  
  Plaintext alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 
  Cipher alphabet:    T 7 J E O F L 3 Q X 8 1 R V K Z 2 M B N 4 9 V C H G 5 D S 6 A P I U Y W

  use the plaintext alphabet to line up the cipher alphabet with the Key of 6DJ3Q11QBN

  6 = 3
  
  D = 1
  
  J = C

  3 = H

  Q = I

  1 = L 

  1 = L

  Q = I

  B = S

  N = T

  Permatutions in cipher text = 36 (26 letters, 10 digits)
  
  Keys = 36!
  
  speed of attempts = 10 to power of 12
  

   Two choices with total key of 36! whicgh are C and D

   C = 36! x 1,000,000,000,000
   = 3.7199333e+53 seconds

   D = 3.7199333e+29


   In the exam i chose answer D by mistake which suggests multiplying the number of permutations instead of divide to find the actual time it takes to decrypt. 


Question 3: Since the question suggests that attacker is about to attack C5 it can be assumed that he doesnt know what the plain text in c5 contains along with the secret key. He has other relevant information relating to the deceyption and encryption methods along with old values.

Question 5: Calcualtions already in the answer
